Hi! My name is Ludovic. I'm a Swiss software engineer passionate about way too many things (computer science, file organization, maintainable software, nature, music, etc.). I'm currently working at [Artios](https://artios.ch) and I'm a part-time lecturer at the [Haute Ecole d'Ingénierie et de Gestion du Canton de Vaud](https://heig-vd.ch/) for the course [Développement d'application internet (DAI)](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course).

On this website, you'll find information about me, my interests and my projects. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or if you'd like to collaborate on a project.

Enjoy your visit!
