# Ludovic Delafontaine's GitHub profile

Hi!

I'm a software engineer from Switzerland specialized in web development,
continuous integration/continuous deployment, and much more.

I'm passionate about music, nature and technology.

I'm more active on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ludelafo) than on GitHub.

Feel free to write me an email for any enquiry!
