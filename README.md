Hi!

I'm a software engineer from Switzerland specialized in web development,
continuous integration/continuous deployment, and much more.

I care about simple, yet reliable and maintainable solutions. I'm a big fan of
open-source software even though I don't contribute as much as I'd like to.

You can learn more about me on my website at [ludelafo.ch](https://ludelafo.ch).

You can find more about my work on my GitLab profile at
